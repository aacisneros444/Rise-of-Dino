# Rise-of-Dino
Multiplayer real-time strategy game I made in summer 2021. Hex-based like Civilization, but with a dinosaur theme and no turn timers.

Looking back, I should have implemented a finite-state machine for the AI, as the AI became a bit of a jumbled mess over time. 
Still though, was a fun project I was really passionate about, and I learned a lot.
